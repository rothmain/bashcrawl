Welcome!

This is a game to teach you the basics of using a POSIX (Linux, BSD, UNIX) terminal.

To start playing, open a terminal.

Type the letters "cd " (just the letters, not the quotes) into the terminal...

Then a space (press the spacebar)...

Once you have something like:

```
$ cd /home/your_username/bashcrawl/entrance
```
or
```
cd entrance
```
press RETURN.
The exact path to the entrance varies, depending on where you saved the file.

Your first move is very important.
Type this into your terminal:
```
ls

cat scroll
```

You are now playing the game.
May the gods save you.

Have fun!
